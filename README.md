# Introductory course to Mathematica

This repository contains a series of introductory Mathematica notebooks.

First, the `lectures_notebooks` are based on Philip Candelas' introductory course on Mathematica: "Symbolic, Numerical and Graphical Scientific computing".
This course was available as part of a few Masters' programmes in the Mathematical Institute, University of Oxford.
The repository also contains an additional tutorial to Matehamtica's `Manipulate[]` function, with examples from my research area.

The notebooks are based on the 2019 version of the course and I provide my own solutions to the homework assessments.
Problem Sheets 1 to 3 contain various exercises and research problems from the late 90's in the area of Calabi-Yau manifolds.
While the reader might not be interested in the topic, these problems provide great use-cases for the analytical power of Mathematica.
The 4th problem sheet is a purely graphical task, being explained within my solution.
